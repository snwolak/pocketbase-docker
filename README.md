## Application Setup

Access the webui at `<your-ip>:80`, for more information check out [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/).

## pb_data, pb_public and pb_migrations

There are multiple configuration & files directories that are mounted into the container. These folders are mapped to the root inside container.

**pb_data** holds your application config and data and should be mapped to your local file system to persist them!

**pb_public** is optional, and is only used for serving static files. (supported in this docker image since version 0.20.7)

**pb_migrations** is optional, this directory allows you to version your DB structure. See https://pocketbase.io/docs/js-migrations/. (supported in this docker image since version 0.20.8)

```yml
volumes:
  - /path/to/data:/pb_data
  - /path/to/public:/pb_public
